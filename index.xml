      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Derrick. My last name rhymes with dining.
Here are some links to other places I&amp;rsquo;m present (more or less) on the ol&#39; interwebs:
 Twitter GitHub LinkedIn  I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer by trade. I also kind of like it as a hobby, though it can get tiresome at times. I suppose I have some other distinguishing features, but I&amp;rsquo;ll just leave it at that for now. This site is where I rarely (really rarely) write and share what I&amp;rsquo;m learning or working on. Don&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if content here seems pretty stale. I generally prefer programming to writing about programming (surprise!</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re relatively new to the statically-typed functional programming scene, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance you&amp;rsquo;ve encountered these fancy-sounding things called &amp;ldquo;algebraic data types&amp;rdquo; (often abbreviated as ADTs), and have been left feeling both a little intimidated by them and confused about what they have to do with algebra. That was my initial experience with them, anyway. I&amp;rsquo;d like to try offering a beginner-friendly introduction to them in a fashion that I think would have helped me understand them sooner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
