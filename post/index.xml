      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re relatively new to the statically-typed functional programming scene, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance you&amp;rsquo;ve encountered these fancy-sounding things called &amp;ldquo;algebraic data types&amp;rdquo; (often abbreviated as ADTs), and have been left feeling both a little intimidated by them and confused about what they have to do with algebra. That was my initial experience with them, anyway. I&amp;rsquo;d like to try offering a beginner-friendly introduction to them in a fashion that I think would have helped me understand them sooner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
